JQuery Study Plan

Resources: Google -> official Documentation, Cheat sheet, some use examples
            JQuery book,

Time Management: Create 4 x 20-25min study blocks, including testing and building.  This way I can investigate, build, and integrate my whys and hows.  Make sure I take breaks and walk away to make sure I'm retaining the information.  Also, make sure I go through the "What am I going to learn, take time to learn, What did I just learn" process.

Build project.

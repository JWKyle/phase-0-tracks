JQuery Study Plan

Resources: Google -> official Documentation, Cheat sheet, some use examples
            JQuery book,

Time Management: Create 4 x 20-25min study blocks, including testing and building.  This way I can investigate, build, and integrate my whys and hows.  Make sure I take breaks and walk away to make sure I'm retaining the information.  Also, make sure I go through the "What am I going to learn, take time to learn, What did I just learn" process.

Build project.

############# Study Methods Used #############

Read introduction to jQuery in John Duckett's book "Javascript & jQuery"

Looked at jquery.org

Found cheat sheet at https://makeawebsitehub.com/jquery-mega-cheat-sheet/

Explored jquery.com and .org

Experimented with code at https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp

I felt the introduction to jQuery and from w3schools got me off on the right foot.  Using the jquery sites were a little dry and rough, but once I got my footing, were useful.  I then used the w3schools populated code try out some of the elements and methods.  I used the Duckett book as my cheat sheet, primarily, since it gave a clearer "why" to my questions.

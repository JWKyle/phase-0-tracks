<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?  Semantic tags give context to some of the code blocks, primarily for organization and to reach a larger audience by allowing people with certain disabilities to be able to view the content.  I find the <header>, <footer>, <main>, and <nav> tags most useful, from an organizational standpoint. -->
<!-- What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?  Browsers read the content from the outside in, through nesting.  -->
<!-- What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? I learned all about snippets, and how to replicate multiple lines of code with a customizable tab-triggered shortcut.  I plan to make more of my own snippets, both for large projects, as well as overall html5 usage. -->
<!-- What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? The placement of some of the semantic tags was the most challenging for me, since I wasn't used to the context (article vs. section, for example).  After getting my head around it in my GPS, I'll just need to practice using them to get used to them. -->

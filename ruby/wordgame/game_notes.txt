Game Notes and pseudocode 

hangman game

The class will be the game title (snipe?)

The First player enters a word
    Word will be put into an array, then split

The second player tries to guess the word 

Guesses are limited, per length of the word. (maybe 2 guesses per letter?)

REPEATED guesses do not count!
    put each entry into an array, and check the array against the guess.  If the guess has already been done, print a message, then try again.

The guesser receives continual feedback.  So, if guesser guesses correctly, demonstrate it via the word.
    initially, the array should show "$$$$$$$$" with the number of items in it
    then, for each letter guessed correctly, it should show the letter in the space
    Use the already guessed array to check each of the array pieces, then print the pieces if they match
    show the number of guesses left.  

Congrat message if they win.  Taunt if they lose.

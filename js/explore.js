// Reverse in JS

// Create a function that takes a string as a parameter, and reverses the string.
  // Since JS takes .length, we can use that to create space for new word?
  // We can use a loop and 'i' instead of .each and a block
    // First, we create a method that takes a string as a parameter
    // Next we take the first letter of the string, and add it to the front of a new array
    // Next we take the new first letter, and add it to the front position of the new array
      // so on and so forth
    // Convert back to string  
    // We print the final string with a console.log
      // do we turn this into an array for spacing?  would shift work?
